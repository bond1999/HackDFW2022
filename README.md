# Tote-ily bags

## How does it work?

QR codes attached to our totes track customers movement throughout a store while they shop. Cameras at the end of isles track the entrance and exit of customers as the QR codes pass through the aisles. Through this QR code tracking, we can study customers behavior by tracking how long they spend in the store, and in what aisles, and what they end up purchasing. By tracking this data over-time, we can learn customer behaviors and habits. Examples might be seeing the increase in sales of an item after a promotion, or during a certain season, or holiday. You could also see customer preferences change overtime. You could also see the differences in the amount of time custoemrs spend in an aisle after rearranging the store to move an aisle elsewhere. 

On top of this, be encouraging customers to use the reusable tote, we cut down on plastic production and pollution, thus making the Earth a better place for everyone.
